Problem
Chef has the binary representation S of a number X with him. He can modify the number by applying the following operation exactly once:

Make X:=X⊕⌊ X/(2^Y)⌋, where (1≤Y≤∣S∣) and ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef wants to maximize the value of X after performing the operation. Help Chef in determining the value of Y which will maximize the value of X after the operation.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of inputs - the first containing the length of binary string S.
The second line of input contains the binary string S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the value of Y which will maximize the value of X after the operation.

Constraints
1≤T≤5⋅10^4
 
1≤∣S∣≤10^5
 
The sum of |S| over all test cases won't exceed 5⋅10^5
 .
S contains the characters 0 and 1 only.
Sample 1:
Input
4
2
10
2
11
3
101
3
110

Output
1
2
1
2
Explanation:
Test case 1: Since S = 10 is the binary representation of 2, the current value of X = 2. On choosing Y=1, X becomes 2 \oplus \lfloor \frac{2}{2^{1}} \rfloor =3. We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.

Test case 2: Since S=11 is the binary representation of 3, the current value of X=3. On choosing Y=2, X becomes 3 \oplus \lfloor \frac{3}{2^{2}} \rfloor = 3 
. We can show that this is the maximum value of XX we can achieve after one operation.

Test case 3: Since S=101 is the binary representation of 5, the current value of X=5. On choosing Y=1, X becomes 5 \oplus \lfloor \frac{5}{2^{1}} \rfloor = 7. We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.

Test case 4: Since S=110 is the binary representation of 6, the current value of X=6. On choosing Y=2, X becomes 6 \oplus \lfloor \frac{6}{2^{2}} \rfloor = 7 . We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.
