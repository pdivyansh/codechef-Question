Problem
On every CodeChef user's profile page, the list of problems that they have set, tested, and written editorials for, is listed at the bottom.

Given the number of problems in each of these 33 categories as X, Y,X,Y, and ZZ respectively (where all three integers are distinct), find if the user has been most active as a Setter, Tester, or Editorialist.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X, Y,X,Y, and ZZ - the number of problems they have set, tested, and written editorials for.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a new line:

Setter, if the user has been most active as a setter.
Tester, if the user has been most active as a tester.
Editorialist, if the user has been most active as an editorialist.
Note that the output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings SETTER, setter, seTTer, and Setter are all considered the same.

Constraints
1≤T≤10^4
 
\1≤X,Y,Z≤100, where X, Y,X,Y, and ZZ are distinct.

Output
Setter
Editorialist
Tester
Setter
Explanation:
Test case 11: The number of problems that the user has set is greater than the number of problems tested or written editorials for. Thus, the user is most active as setter.

Test case 22: The number of problems that the user has written editorials for, is greater than the number of problems set or tested. Thus, the user is most active as editorialist.

Test case 33: The number of problems that the user has tested is greater than the number of problems set or written editorials for. Thus, the user is most active as tester.

Test case 44: The number of problems that the user has set is greater than the number of problems tested or written editorials for. Thus, the user is most active as setter.
