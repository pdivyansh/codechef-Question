Problem
In Chefland, a tax of rupees 10 is deducted if the total income is strictly greater than rupees 100.

Given that total income is X rupees, find out how much money you get.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer X — your total income.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the amount of money you get.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤X≤1000
Sample 1:
Input
4
5
105
101
100
Output
5
95
91
100
Explanation:
Test case 1: Your total income is 5 rupees which is less than 100 rupees. Thus, no tax would be deducted and you get 5 rupees.

Test case 2: Your total income is 105 rupees which is greater than 100 rupees. Thus, a tax of 10 rupees would be deducted and you get 105-10 = 95 rupees.

Test case 3: Your total income is 101 rupees which is greater than 100 rupees. Thus, a tax of 10 rupees would be deducted and you get 101-10 = 91 rupees.

Test case 4: Your total income is 100 rupees which is equal to 100 rupees. Thus, no tax would be deducted and you get 100 rupees.
