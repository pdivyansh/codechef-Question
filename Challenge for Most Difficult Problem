Problem
In a competition, there are three 33 problems: P, Q, RP,Q,R. Alice challenges Bob that problem RR will be the most difficult, whereas Bob predicts that problem QQ will be the most difficult.

You are given three integers S_P, S_Q, S_RS 
P
​
 ,S 
Q
​
 ,S 
R
​
 , which represent the number of successful submissions of the problems P, Q, RP,Q,R. Each problem is guaranteed to have a varied amount of submissions. Decide who will win the challenge.

If Alice wins the challenge (that is, if problem RR is the most difficult), then output AliceAlice.

If Bob wins the challenge (that is, if problem QQ is the most difficult), then output BobBob.

If no one wins the challenge (since problem PP is the most difficult), output DrawDraw.

Note: The problem with the fewest successful submissions is the most difficult.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer TT, which represents the number of test cases. The following is a description of TT test cases.
Each test case's first and only line comprises three space-separated integers S_P, S_Q, S_RS 
, which represent the number of successful submissions of problems P, Q, RP,Q,R, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print the winner of the challenge or the word "Draw" if no one wins the challenge.
Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
1 \leq S_P,S_Q,S_R \leq 1001≤S 

 ≤100
S_P, S_Q, S_RS 

  are all distinct.

Explanation:
Test case 11: Because problem PP turns out to be the most difficult, no one wins the challenge.

Test case 22: Problem QQ proves to be the most difficult, thus Bob wins the challenge.

Test case 33: Problem RR proves to be the most difficult, thus Alice wins the challenge.
