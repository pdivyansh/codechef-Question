Problem
There are 101 citizens in Chefland. It is election time in Chefland and 3 parties, A,B, and C are contesting the elections. Party A receives X_A votes, party B receives X_B votes, and party C receives X_C votes.

The constitution of Chefland requires a particular party to receive a clear majority to form the government. A party is said to have a clear majority if it receives strictly greater than 50 votes.

If any party has a clear majority, print the winning party (A, B or C). Otherwise, print NOTA.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains 33 space-separated integers — X_A, X_B, and X_C.
Output Format
For each test case, if any party has a clear majority, print the winning party (A, B or C). Otherwise, print NOTA.

You can print each letter of the string in any case (upper or lower) (for instance, strings Nota, nOtA and notA will be considered identical).

Constraints
1≤T≤500
0 <=X_A, X_B, X_C <=101
X_A + X_B + X_C = 101
