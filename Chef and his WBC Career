Problem
Chef has been participating in World's Best Chef (WBC) for 7 years in a row now. Chef calls his WBC career successful if the number of times he has won is strictly greater than the number of times he didn't. WBC takes place annually. Chef's WBC career is described as an array of containing 7 elements. The ith
 element a_i is 1 if Chef has won in the ith year and 0 otherwise.

Find if Chef's career was successful or not.

Input Format
First line of input contains a single integer T, number of testcases. The description of each test case follows.
The first and the only line of each test case contains 7 space-separated integers, ith of them is a_i.
Output Format
For each test case print "Yes" (without quotes) if Chef's career was successful and "No" otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1≤T≤20
a_i ∈{0,1}
Sample 1:
Input
3
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 0

Output
