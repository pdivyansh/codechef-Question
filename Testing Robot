Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers. He started testing the robot by letting it move on a line.

Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate x=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of N commands, described by a string S with length N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left (decreasing x by 1) or to the right (increasing x by 1), respectively.

How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? A point p is visited by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is x=p.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of points visited by the robot.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
∣X∣≤1,000,000
S contains only characters 'L' and 'R'
Subtask
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Sample 1:
Input
2
6 10
RRLLLL
2 0
LL

Output
5
3
Explanation:
Example case 1: The robot followed the path 10→11→12→11→10→9→8.

Example case 2: The robot followed the path 0→−1→−2.
