Problem
Chef has a square-shaped chart paper with the side length equal to NN. He wants to cut out K×K squares from this chart paper.

Find the maximum number of K×K squares he can cut from the entire chart paper.

Note that, some part of the chart paper might not be a included in any K×K cutout square.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K — the side length of the entire chart paper and the side length of the cutout squares.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of K×K squares Chef can cut from the entire chart paper.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤K≤N≤1000
Sample 1:
Input
3
5 1
2 2
5 2
Output
25
1
4
Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef can cut out 25 squares of size 1×1 from the entire 5×5 chart paper.

Test case 2: Chef can cut out 1 square of size 2×2 from the entire 2×2 chart paper.

Test case 3: Chef can cut out 4 squares of size 2×2 from the entire 5×5 chart paper.
