Problem
A problem setter is called an expert if at least 50% of their problems are approved by Chef.

Munchy submitted X problems for approval. If Y problems out of those were approved, find whether Munchy is an expert or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a two space-separated integers X and Y - the number of problems submitted and the number of problems that were approved by Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if Munchy is an expert. Otherwise, print NO.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤Y≤X≤10^6
 
Sample 1:
Input
4
5 3
1 1
4 1
2 1
Output
YES
YES
NO
YES
Explanation:
Test case 1: We are given that 3 out of 5 problems were approved. Thus, 60% of the problems were approved. Since at least 50% of the problems were approved, Munchy is an expert.

Test case 2: We are given that 1 out of 1 problems were approved. Thus,100% of the problems were approved. Since at least 50% of the problems were approved, Munchy is an expert.

Test case 3: We are given that 1 out of 4 problems were approved. Thus, 25% of the problems were approved. Since at least 50% of the problems were not approved, Munchy is not an expert.

Test case 4: We are given that 1 out of 2 problems were approved. Thus, 50% of the problems were approved. Since at least 50% of the problems were approved, Munchy is an expert.
