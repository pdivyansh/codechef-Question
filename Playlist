Problem
Chef's playlist contains 33 songs named A, BA,B, and CC, each of duration exactly XX minutes. Chef generally plays these 33 songs in loop, i.e, A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A \rightarrow \dotsA→B→C→A→B→C→A→…

Chef went on a train journey of NN minutes and played his playlist on loop for the whole journey. How many times did he listen to the song CC completely?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers N, XN,X.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of times Chef listens to the song CC completely.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 10001≤T≤1000
1 \leq N \leq 1001≤N≤100
1 \leq X \leq 101≤X≤10

Explanation:
Test case 11: Since each song is of duration 11 minute and the journey is 66 minutes long, Chef listens each of the songs A, B, CA,B,C twice.

Test case 22: Since each song is of duration 11 minute and the journey is 55 minutes long, Chef listens the songs A, BA,B twice but CC only once.

Test case 33: Since each song is of duration 22 minutes and the journey is 1111 minutes long, Chef listens the songs A, BA,B twice but CC only once. Note that Chef is in the middle of listening to song CC for the second time when the journey ends, but it is not counted since he hasn't listened to it fully.

Test case 44: Chef cannot hear any song since the journey is shorter than his song duration.
